	* Version 0.5.1
	* Allows to lookup the object names for the build-in database objects
	  by reading `oid2name.txt' file, instead of reading the system
	  catalogs through a database connection,
	* Added '-f, --file' option to read an oid2name cache file,
	* Added '-g, --gen_oid2name' option to generate an oid2name file
	  to cache oids and object names in the system catalogs.
